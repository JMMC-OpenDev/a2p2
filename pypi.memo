Pypi deployement
----------------
(from https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/ )

Look at the a2p2/version.py then run:

    ``python -m build``

    ``python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*``

    ``python -m twine upload dist/*``

or
```
rm -rf dist/* ; python setup.py sdist ; twine upload dist/*
```

You may have to install some pre-requisites:

    ``pip install --upgrade build twine``
